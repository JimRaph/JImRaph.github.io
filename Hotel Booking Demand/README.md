# Hotel Booking Demand Analysis & Prediction

## üìå Overview
This project explores the **Hotel Booking Demand** dataset to uncover insights about booking patterns, cancellations, and customer behavior.  
The analysis focuses on factors influencing cancellations and builds a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a customer canceling their reservation.

## üéØ Motivation
Efficient room allocation is vital for hotel operations.  
By predicting cancellations and understanding customer booking behavior, hotels can:
- Optimize room allocation.  
- Anticipate cancellations before they occur.  
- Improve efficiency in day-to-day operations.

## üîç Process

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.  
- Standardized and scaled features.  
- Prepared data for exploratory analysis and model training.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Family size vs. cancellation rate**  
- **Quarterly cancellation trends**  
- **Lead time vs. likelihood of cancellation**  
- **Monthly and quarterly distributions of bookings**  

### 3. Data Visualization
- Occurrence of each family size.  
- Booking status across months.  
- Canceled bookings across months.  
- Quarterly cancellation distribution.  
- Seasonal cancellation trends.  

### 4. Predictive Modeling
Built and compared machine learning models to predict cancellation likelihood:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **XGBoost Classifier**  

**Evaluation:**  
- Cross-validation with K-Fold.  
- Accuracy score used as main metric.
