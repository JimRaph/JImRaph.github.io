Point of Sale(POS) Data from a Supermarket: Transactions and Cashier Operations

Retailers/Businesses need to understand their checkout data to plan effectively and potentially increase profit.

We explore questions like

Do people spend more with card or cash?
How many items do people buy at different times?
Are self-service checkouts quicker than those with a cashier?
What is the trend in amount across days?
Should stores be open on Sundays?
and more
