In building Machine Learning models, ensemble method sometimes often give the better performance.

Ensemble involves a Base Learner and a Meta Learner. The base learner acts as input to the meta learner which outputs the final results.

I use DecisionTreeClassifier and KNeighboursClassifier as the base learner and Logistic Regression model as the meta learner.
