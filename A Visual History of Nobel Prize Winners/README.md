## üìå Project Overview  
This project explores the Nobel Prize dataset made available by the Nobel Foundation, covering all prize winners from **1901 to 2016**.  
The objective was to analyze historical patterns and answer key questions about **gender representation, country dominance, age trends, and repeat laureates**.  

Through this project, I demonstrate skills in **exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and storytelling with data**.

## üéØ Objectives  
The analysis aimed to answer the questions like:  
1. What is the **proportion of Nobel winners by gender and country**?  
2. Does the **USA dominate Nobel prizes**, and how has this trend evolved by decade?  
3. What is the **gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner**? How do specific prize categories (Physics, Medicine, Literature, etc.) compare in gender imbalance?  
4. Who was the **first woman to win a Nobel Prize**, and in what category?  
5. How many laureates have won **more than once**?  
6. What is the **typical age of a Nobel Prize winner**?  
7. Are there **age trends within different categories** (e.g., Physics vs. Literature)?  
8. Who are the **oldest and youngest winners** in Nobel Prize history?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** for analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Matplotlib** (where needed for customization)

## üìä Key Insights  
- **Gender Imbalance:** The majority of Nobel laureates have been male, with female representation varying across categories (Medicine and Literature being comparatively better).  
- **Country Dominance:** The USA has consistently produced the highest share of Nobel laureates, especially from the mid-20th century onward.  
- **First Woman:** Marie Curie was the first woman laureate, winning in Physics (1903) and later in Chemistry (1911).  
- **Repeat Laureates:** A handful of individuals, such as Marie Curie and Linus Pauling, have won multiple times.  
- **Age Trends:** Winners in Physics and Chemistry tend to be younger, while Literature and Peace winners are typically older.  
- **Youngest Winner:** Malala Yousafzai (Peace Prize, age 17).  
- **Oldest Winner:** Leonid Hurwicz (Economics, age 90).
