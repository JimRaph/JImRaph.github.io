# The GitHub History of the Scala Language

This project analyzes the real-world development history of the **Scala programming language** using repository data mined from GitHub. With nearly **30,000 commits** spanning over a decade, Scala provides a rich dataset to study open-source software evolution, developer contributions, and project activity.

## 📌 Project Overview

Scala is a **general-purpose programming language** that has become popular among data scientists. As an open-source project, its entire development history — including commits, pull requests, and code reviews — is publicly available.  

In this project, we worked with a dataset previously mined and extracted from GitHub to **clean, analyze, and visualize** insights about the Scala project.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains three files:

- **`pulls_2011-2013.csv`** – Information about pull requests from late 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.  
- **`pulls_2014-2018.csv`** – Information about pull requests from 2014 to 2018.  
- **`pull_files.csv`** – Details of files modified in each pull request.  

**Source:** DataCamp

## 🔍 Some Key Explorations

- Determined **whether the project is still actively maintained**.  
- Investigated **camaraderie and collaboration within the project community**.  
- Identified **files changed in the last ten pull requests**.  
- Visualized the **contributions of individual developers** over time.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data analysis and visualization  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization
