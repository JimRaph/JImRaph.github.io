# üóÑÔ∏è Data Modeling with SQL: Building a Dimensional Data Pipeline  
*Star and Snowflake Schema design for analytics on historical workstation sales data (1980‚Äì1996).*

## üìå Project Overview  
In this project, I designed and implemented a **data transformation pipeline** for analytics using SQL. The focus was on **dimensional data modeling** with both **Star** and **Snowflake schemas**, applied to a dataset of **computer workstation sales**.  

Poorly modeled data can lead to long, expensive queries. By restructuring the dataset into fact and dimension tables, the pipeline improves efficiency, supports historical tracking, and enables robust analytical queries.

## üéØ Some Actions Taken  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Converted columns to proper data types.  
   - Adjusted units of measure (e.g., degrees ‚Üí radians where appropriate).  

2. **Dimensional Modeling**  
   - Designed **Star and Snowflake schemas** for analytic queries.  
   - Built dimension tables such as:  
     - **Company Dimension**  
     - **Product Offerings Dimension**  
     - **Integration Dimension**  

3. **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs):**  
   - Implemented **Type 2 Dimensions** (track attribute changes over time).  
   - Implemented **Type 4 Dimensions** (manage historical data with separate tables).  

4. **Fact Table Creation**  
   - Built `workstation_sales` fact table.  
   - Distinguished between **additive facts vs. non-additive facts**.  

5. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Leveraged **DuckDB** for efficient querying.  
   - Benchmarked queries with `timeit` to compare performance before and after dimensional modeling.
