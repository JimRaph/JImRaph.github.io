I explored Natural Language Processing using Tensorflow and Gensim. I choose Gensim to utilise its word2vec capability.

Attending high accuracy was not the aim of this exploration.
I also choose to use numpy's vectorize function instead of for loops in some cases.

The dataset used can be found in the data folder
